Python Combine/Merge multiple excel/csv files into 1 master excel file using pandas,openpyxl,xlsxwriter 

Many times we come across requirement when we are to combine multiple excel/CSV files to generate Matser Excel(xlsx) File. Using power of pandas,openpyxl and xlsxwriter we can achieve this with a common function(40 lines of code). I am using around 50 CSV/50 Excel files respectively in the folder as input files for this demo.
